---+ Introduction
This package contains software for the H->Zg->mmg analysis that is
specific for the muon channel and needs the full CMSSW framework.

---+ Production Setup Recipe
To checkout and compile the package at FNAL to reproduce selection
yields on the sync twiki https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HtoZgtoMUMU
for 2011 data and MC in CMSSW_42x is not available yet.

---+ Development Setup Recipe
To checkout and compile the package at FNAL so that you can continue 
develepment you can do:

kinit -A -f username@FNAL.GOV
ssh cmslpc-sl5.fnal.gov
bash

source /uscmst1/prod/sw/cms/bashrc uaf

## To be able to use CVS at FNAL. Requires typing CERN username and password.

# cd nobackup/work/cmssw
if [[ ! -d /tmp/$(whoami) ]]; then
    mkdir /tmp/$(whoami)
fi
cd $(mktemp -d -p /tmp/$(whoami))
